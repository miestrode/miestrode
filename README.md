# :wave: Shalom!
I'm **Yoav**, and welcome to my Github! I am a student, who programs in his free time. I like to solve logic problems, play Chess, play Minecraft and of course, program. I am interested in learning about new paradigms of programming, like the Functional, or Logic paradigms. 

## :information_source: Some facts about me
- I mainly program in **Rust**, **Python** and **MCfunction**, although I am looking to learn other programming languages.
- Before trying out more traditional programming languages, I worked in MCfunction (I still do :smile:).
- My WIP programming language, [Bell](https://github.com/Miestrode/bell/), was created to solve the problems I have with MCfunction.
- I used to use Windows, but then switched to [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), and later, to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
- I like solving mathematical and computer sciency puzzles. They are one of the reasons I got into programming, aside from what I have previously mentioned.
- I live in Israel, as you can see on my profile.

# :hammer_and_wrench: What are you working on right now?
## :dark_sunglasses: Secret Minecraft IR
With over 7 unique Minecraft Data pack transpiling languages, the need for standardization is grave.
As of today, every language needs to implement it's own backend. This is why I began working on this project. I hope to eliminate (mostly) this need, once and for all.

I hope that in the future, just like a large amount of regular language implementations use LLVM, so will be the case for this project. "LLVM For Minecraft".

## :bell: Bell
Bell has truly been a major learning exprience for me. I begun working on this "mammoth" of a project around two years ago, in an effort to solve some problems I had with MCfunction, understand how the programming languages I have been using work and to strengthen my programming skills.

Bell is currently in the middle of a refactor, designed to introduce better, more functional features into it, and to improve it's UI.

### :mailbox: Do I have to contact you via Email?
No! Of course not. I also have a Discord account. Feel free to talk to me `Miestrode#8204`. Preferably about things related to my Github (If you come from here).

### What about Fisher?
I am halting most work on Fisher, in order to focus more on other projects, to hopefully learn a lot more. The Project isn't dead however, it should be said. It is just on hold.
