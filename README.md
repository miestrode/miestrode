# :wave: Shalom!
I'm **Yoav**, and welcome to my Github! I am a student, who programs in his free time. I like to solve logic problems, play Chess, play Minecraft and of course, program. I am interested in learning about new paradigms of programming, like the Functional, or Logic paradigms. 

## :information_source: Some facts about me
- I mainly program in **Rust**, **Python** and **MCfunction**, although I am looking to learn other programming languages.
- Before trying out more traditional programming languages, I worked in MCfunction (I still do :smile:).
- My WIP programming language, [Bell](https://github.com/Miestrode/bell/), was created to solve the problems I have with MCfunction.
- I used to use Windows, but then switched to [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), and later, to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
- I like solving mathematical and computer sciency puzzles. They are one of the reasons I got into programming, aside from what I have previously mentioned.
- I live in Israel, as you can see on my profile.

# :hammer_and_wrench: What are you working on right now?
Right now, I have two *important* unfinished projects. I'm not working on them actively, but I am in general working on them.

## :bell: Bell
Probably the biggest one. I started Bell around two years ago, in an effort to solve some problems I had with MCfunction, understand how the programming languages I have been using work and to strengthen my programming skills.

Bell is currently in the middle of a refactor, designed to introduce better, more functional features into it, and to improve it's UI.

## :fishing_pole_and_fish: Fisher
Chess is a hobby of mine, although I'm not particularly good at it. The obvious solution to this is to spend several months of my life creating a program that plays Chess for me.

More seriously though, while I believe Fisher will never beat any other prominent Chess engine, I do hope it will allow me to better my knowledge of Rust, and hopefully of Bitwise operations as well.

Yes, Chess programming is quite the rabbit hole.

### :mailbox: Do I have to contact you via Email?
No! Of course not. I also have a Discord account. Feel free to talk to me `Miestrode#8204`. Preferably about things related to my Github (If you come from here).
